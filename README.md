# hello-world
this is my first repository

suh ladies and gentlemen, this is i'm mike and i love programming. don't really have a language i use the most, i basically learn multiple ones at the same time rn. to be more specific: python, c#, c, c++, java, node.js, css.

btw pineapple on pizza makes sense if you think about it, because it counters the saltiness and spiciness of the other things on there but you uncultured swines will never understand anyway (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
